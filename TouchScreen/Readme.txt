This file represents an attempt to create a remote touch screen using a TFT 2.4-inch screen. However, the project was discontinued due to limitations with the touch screen module, which occupied all Arduino pins except one. This constraint made it nearly impossible to integrate an NRF transmitter with the Arduino. Instead, the project shifted towards utilizing WiFi with the ESP8266 module.

The TFT 2.4-inch screen libraries contained errors, further complicating the project. While some resources for making the screen work are included in this file, most of the project remains unfinished.

//////////////////////////here is how to solve problem with ///////////////////////////////////

Go to this website to download the library Zip_files ----> 

http://www.lcdwiki.com/2.4inch_Arduino_Display

for better understanding go to ----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GT_sgbKQrc 



before starting you must make some changes 

in the code change this part 


#define YP A1  // must be an analog pin, use "An" notation!
#define XM A2  // must be an analog pin, use "An" notation!
#define YM 7   // can be a digital pin
#define XP 6   // can be a digital pin 


			TO 


#define YP A3  // must be an analog pin, use "An" notation!
#define XM A2  // must be an analog pin, use "An" notation!
#define YM 9   // can be a digital pin
#define XP 8   // can be a digital pin 

and find Id part and Set it to  --->   tft.begin(0x7575); // SDFP5408


then go to the library file im the documents ---> C:\Users\Ibrahim_Essam\Documents\Arduino\libraries\SPFD5408-master

and change line 163 TO return TSPoint( 1103-x, 1063-y, z);
