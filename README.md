# Thrust-Vector-Controlled-Rocket-Design

This project proposes the development of a Thrust Vector-Controlled (TVC) rocket as an alternative to drones for high-altitude payload delivery. Drones face limitations such as
cost, payload size restrictions, and reliance on air density, making them inefficient for high-altitude missions. The TVC rocket, inspired by SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, utilizes 
thrust vector control for precise navigation and payload delivery regardless of air density.

The project aims for cost-effectiveness by using off-the-shelf components like pressure sensors, IMUs, and Arduinos, integrated into a single PCB. This approach, coupled with
lightweight 3D-printed materials for the rocket chassis, aims to reduce costs significantly.

Applications include academic research and medical deliveries to remote areas. The rocket's design focuses on stability optimization, utilizing OpenRocket software for
simulations and Fusion 360 for 3D component design. Additionally, a water pressure chamber was introduced for cost-effective testing.

The flight computer comprises various sensors for monitoring acceleration, rotation, and altitude, essential for making critical flight decisions. These include MPU6050 IMUs, 
BMP280 barometers, EEPROMs, and battery level monitors.

Overall, the TVC rocket project offers an affordable and efficient solution for high-altitude payload delivery, potentially revolutionizing academic and humanitarian applications.
